# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**, helping to understand public opinion on specific topics or keywords.

## 🧠 What This Project Does

- 🔹 Load and preprocess tweet data (cleaning, tokenization, etc.)
- 🔹 Remove stopwords, URLs, mentions, hashtags, emojis
- 🔹 Convert text into numerical form using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer
- 🔹 Train models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM
- 🔹 Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- 🔹 Visualize sentiment distribution using plots

---

## 📈 Features Used

- Tweet text
- Sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Optional metadata like date, user info (if available)
